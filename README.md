# Food-Festival

## Description

The goal of this app was to create a PWA that behaved like an app and maintained functionality with and without an internet connection. A user can enter deposits and withdrawls and the app will track these transactions even when the interenet connection is spotty. 

This project helped me understand what PWA's are and how they maintain functionality without an internet connection.  I learned how to audit my project using Google Lighthouse, and how to create a service worker (that intercepts fetch requests) from scratch, how to utitlize indexedDB for offline functionality, and how to generate a manifest.

## Installation

When the user natigates to teh deployed project, they should be able to obtain all functionality and view it on their mobile device. 

## Usage

When the user navigates to the deployed product, they should be able to enter their deposits and withdrawls and have the graph mimic their actions on their phone or other device, whether or not the internet is connected.  The user will have to connect to the app using the internet the first time, but after this, their transactions will be recorded by the Service Worker and Cache APIs and pushed to the internet when they regain service.
